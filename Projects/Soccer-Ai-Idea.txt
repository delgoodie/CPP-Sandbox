Soccer Evolution Simulator with Neural Network:

All players have speed, strength, ball control, shot, and pass traits

Plyers evolve and bad players are killed off

Success is a float grade average boosted by successful passing, shooting, dribbling, stealing, and blocking

Neural Network manipulates player to make run time decisions in game

Instead of Q1 - Q4 the field would be divided into about 20 sectors

Passing and shooting might be overarching commands with seperate weights determining the vector of the action

Instead of (is there an opponent in Q1?) for an input neuron, nuerons could take distances between 0-1 (distance from opponent?. In this setup nodes would be placed on the grid points
the map and would only be non zero if an opponent was closer to them than the length of one node. ie if an opponent was on the node, its value would be 1. If an opponent was directly an 
adjacient node, its value would be 0

Another neuron type could be more complex object neurons that keep track of each team member and opponent, storing the position, direction, and some booleans like hasBall about each player
on the field to give the network a better understanding of its surroundings.

^^Goal of this experiment is not to overload the network with knowledge. Should be given less info than an actual soccer player, to see if (with the limited info) it can make superior 
reasoning and come up with its own strategies.

Potentially a team chemisty factor, a given teammate is more likely to pass to a certain other teammate under certain conditions

Maybe ai should factor in direction, speed, momentum of each player and or the ball.

^^UPDATE: Could start with MoveUp, ShootDown, PassRight, but should use float vectors to direct commands in the end: Shoot {0.365, 0.687}, Move {1, 0} <- unit vector
